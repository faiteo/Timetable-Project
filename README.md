# Timetable-Project
School Timetable Planner

This project is developed using C#.Net. The program uses an algorithm to automatically plan a timetable. It uses the following resources as input: (Courses, Students Teachers, Rooms and Timeslots). The output is a Schedule/Timetable. The program is coupled with a console application and a simple web interface that is primarily used for viewing the generated timetable, by using an ID.
Apart from the ability to plan a timetable, this solution also ensures that no teacher is scheduled to teach at more than one location at the same time. It also ensures that no Team(hold) is scheduled for two different lectures at the same, in different locations.
The solution ensures that each course can maximum be taught once or twice a week and once a day.
